# Windows Sysinfo

A PowerShell script that runs a few basic system checks.
It maybe useful for system admins testing systems before deployment

# Requirements

To run the script you can do the following

1. Download and extract the .zip file
2. Open PowerShell (or PowerShell ISE) as an Administrator
3. On the prompt, change to the directory where you extracted the files: e.g. - cd c:\temp
4. Next, to run either script, enter in the following: e.g. - .\system_check.ps1

 
# TODOs
